## Executive Summary

### The Problem: "Package Sprawl"

The uncontrolled proliferation of 100+ unstandardized packages in SAP CPI—leading to operational chaos, credential hell, and tenant capacity crises. This also triggers **"User Sprawl"** in SAP BTP Cockpit, with one technical user per package, creating systematic credential management crisis and complex maintenance overhead.

### The Solution: PDCP

PDCP consolidates integrations into **one package per business domain** with **tiered technical users by criticality**.

### Real Impact

- **39 packages → 4** (↓90%)
- **39 technical users → 12 tiered users** (↓69%)
- **273 min deploy → 14.5 min** (↑18.8× faster)

### Deploy Time Calculation Formula

```
T_total = (N_packages × 2 min) + (M_iFlows × 0.5 min)
```

Where:
- **N_packages** = Number of CPI packages to deploy
- **M_iFlows** = Number of iFlows to deploy
- **2 min** = Average package deployment time
- **0.5 min** = Average iFlow deployment time

### Time Investment

- ⏱️ **Executive summary:** 2 min
- ⏱️ **Full technical guide:** 10 ~ 35 min

## Target Audience & Prerequisites

### Target Audience

- SAP CPI Platform Owners & Integration Architects fighting Package Sprawl
- Enterprise Architects standardizing BTP governance
- Solution Architects implementing DCRP (Part I) → PDCP synergy
- Senior Developers needing iFlow DNA conventions
- Governance Teams enforcing naming standards

### Prerequisites

- Basic SAP CPI package/iFlow knowledge (no APIM required)

### How to Read This Blog

**Prerequisites:**

Read **DCRP (Part I)** for full context (especially Chapter 7) - Or start with **Chapters 1-5** for Package Sprawl solutions only - it's for SAP Cloud Platform Integration, independent of Gateway concepts.

- **If you read it but found the pattern challenging:** Start with Chapters 1-5. The DCRP routing logic is complex, and understanding the backend consolidation first will help.
- **If you read it and built a PoC:** You're ready for Chapters 6-7. The DCRP + PDCP synergy demonstrates the complete Gateway-to-Backend solution.

### Note on the JavaScript Brain DCRP Routing Engine

The current implementation (v8.0) is under active development toward a universal, plug-and-play routing engine capable of handling any vendor, any scenario, with zero-code onboarding.

**The goal:** a single JavaScript brain that adapts to every enterprise integration landscape SAP APIM automatically at global scale. This is complex architectural work—expect iterative refinements as edge cases emerge.

I developed the full complexity of this logic and these patterns independently, over many nights, based on real-world enterprise challenges observed across multiple projects.

After extensively analyzing universal dynamic routing patterns available in the API's in market, combined with deep research and intensive hands-on experimentation, I arrived at the best and most balanced version I could realistically design.

While this solution reflects my strongest architectural judgment and practical experience, it is naturally impossible to anticipate every possible global scenario.

## The Complete Architecture: DCRP + PDCP

Before diving into the Package Sprawl problem, let's visualize the complete end-to-end integration architecture. This diagram demonstrates how **DCRP (Gateway Layer)** and **PDCP (Backend Layer)** work together to deliver enterprise-scale domain governance.

![Figure 1: Complete DCRP + PDCP End-to-End Architecture](images/figura-01-complete-architecture.png)  
*Figure 1: Complete DCRP + PDCP End-to-End Architecture*

### Architecture Highlights – Sales O2C Domain

- **Left (Consumer Layer):** 9 external systems (Salesforce US/EMA, HubSpot, Dynamics 365, Vendor Partners)
- **Center (Gateway Layer):** SAP API Management with DCRP routing engine (KVM + JavaScript v8)
- **Right (Backend Layer):** Cloud Platform Integration with PDCP package consolidation
- **Protocols:** HTTPS (TLS 1.2+), SOAP, ODATA

### Result

- **13 proxies → 1 unified gateway**
- **39 packages → 4 governed domains**
- **39 users → 12 tiered credentials**

**Theory meets Execution:** On the left of the diagram, you see the blueprint of the DCRP Engine—utilizing KVM and JS v8.0 to centralize governance. In the actual system screenshot (Figure 2), you see the surgical reality within SAP APIM: a single Domain-Centric facade protecting the core, where the `backend.system` is no longer a fixed URL, but a strategic variable.

## Introduction - The Battlefield Beyond the Gateway

Hello again,

In my previous article, we addressed **"Proxy Sprawl"** using the **DCRP (Domain-Centric Routing Pattern)**, which reduced API Proxy onboarding time to **30 seconds** by leveraging a metadata-driven engine (KVM, JavaScript, and Statistic Collectors).

However, a critical truth remains: **establishing a clean, governed Gateway is only half the battle.** If the SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) backend remains unorganized, the overall integration landscape remains fragile and difficult to maintain.

With over 15 years of experience worldwide perspective spanning three generations of SAP integration (XI/PI/PO) and now SAP Integration Suite, I am introducing the **PDCP (Package Domain-Centric Pattern)**.

### Real-world trigger

I saw a critical scenario where **3 new tenants were allocated just to organize the apocalyptic Package Sprawl chaos**. It was so unmanageable I nearly left the project—it was impossible to understand.

This guide serves as a **technical blueprint of design name and name convention of CPI Package and Iflow name**. If you have already implemented the DCRP Gateway, this pattern is essential to ensure end-to-end symmetry.

### Architectural Disclaimer

This framework provides a high-level standard, but every organization must evaluate its unique landscape and adapt these rules to its specific governance needs. Importantly, **this pattern does not apply to SAP Standard Packages** (pre-packaged content from the SAP Business Accelerator Hub). To preserve update compatibility and support, standard SAP content must maintain its original naming and structure.

My choice to use **strictly lowercase letters** in the following examples is deliberate; it ensures maximum compatibility, prevents case-sensitivity errors, and maintains clean, uniform sortability across all SAP BTP components.

## 1 - THE CPI PACKAGE SPRAWL: A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CRISIS

**Package Sprawl is Operational Debt.** When your tenant lacks a design pattern, every maintenance task becomes a search-and-rescue mission.

> **Note:** The prefix used in these examples is purely illustrative. In this case, `[nx]` represents a generic placeholder that should be replaced with your organization's specific naming standard.

### Is your environment a "Technical Silo" graveyard?

```
CPI Tenant 
├── Package Salesforce.Integration
├── Package Salesforce_Orders_NEW_FINAL
├── Package VTEX.Flow
├── Package MercadoLivre_Shipments_API
├── Package D365.Finance.Payments.v2.0
├── Package D365-Invoices
├── Package ServiceNow_Incidents_Sync
├── Package Logistics_3PL_Freight_v3
├── Package SAP__MasterData_Customer_v2
├── Package Temp_Testing_DoNotDelete_QAS
├── Package Dev.Customer.Old.Logic 
└── [+147 more packages...] (Legacy debt)
```

**Architectural Note:** The list above is a conceptual model of the "Sprawl" phenomenon. It illustrates the operational debt inherent in environments lacking a formal naming convention or design pattern.

![Figure 4: CPI Package Sprawl](images/figura-04-package-sprawl.png)  
*Figure 4 - CPI Package Sprawl*

### 1.1 - The Three Symptoms of Package Sprawl

1. **Inconsistent Naming:** Packages named after projects, apps, or vendors, making search impossible.
2. **Redundant Governance:** Multiple packages handling the same domain (e.g., three different "Sales" packages).
3. **Credential Chaos:** Each package often requiring its own Service User, leading to a management nightmare.

![Figure 5: The Package Chaos](images/figura-05-package-chaos.png)  
*Figure 5 – The package chaos: Visualizing the CPI Package Sprawl Crisis*

---

## 2 - THE PDCP ARCHITECTURAL DEFINITION

The **Package Domain-Centric Pattern (PDCP)** is a governance-driven architecture designed to eliminate the "Technical Silo" mindset. It consolidates integration assets by **Business Domain** (*What is the business doing?*) rather than application source (*Where is it coming from?*).

### 2.1 The Core Principle: Process Over Application

Traditional architecture creates a new package for every new connection. PDCP treats the **Business Process** as the primary container.

- **The Sprawl (Old Way):** Three separate packages for `Salesforce_Orders`, `Dynamics_Orders`, and `Shopify_Orders`. This leads to fragmented security contexts, redundant mappings, and zero discoverability.
- **The PDCP (Expert Way):** One single "Sales" package—`[company-prefix].[business-domain].[sub-subprocess-domain].integrations`. All order-related iFlows live here, sharing the same domain governance and technical user strategy.

**The Result:** You transition from managing hundreds of "Technical Orphans" to managing a few "Intelligent Domain Hubs."

### 2.2 The Three Pillars of PDCP

To sustain this pattern, your architecture must stand on three pillars:

1. **Consolidation:** Mandatory grouping of all iFlows by business area (Sales, Finance, Logistics). "Project-specific" or "Vendor-specific" packages are strictly prohibited.
2. **Standardization:** Implementation of the **iFlow DNA naming convention** for instant discovery and automated categorization via SAP Cloud ALM.
3. **Governance:** A Domain Architect acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring every new integration fits the existing domain logic rather than creating a new silo.

![Figure 6: The PDCP Three Pillars](images/figura-06-three-pillars.png)  
*Figure 6 – The PDCP three pillars.*

### 2.3 Independence vs. DCRP Synergy

- **Standalone PDCP:** Even without an API Gateway, you achieve a massive consolidation of the SAP Cloud Platform Integration packages, footprint and simplified credential management following this blueprint.
- **DCRP Synergy:** When combined with the Domain-Centric Routing Pattern (Gateway), you create a **"Perfect Mirror" architecture**. The Gateway handles the semantic routing, while the PDCP package provides the structured, high-performance execution layer.

![Figure 7: The PDCP Blueprint](images/figura-07-pdcp-blueprint.png)  
*Figure 7 – The PDCP Blueprint: Consolidating Backend Sprawl into Governed Business Domains*

## 3. THE SOLUTION: PDCP (Package Domain-Centric Pattern)

### 3.1 The Central Principle

> **Important:** This section demonstrates the tiered user strategy using Sales O2C as a reference example. The pattern shows **3 tiered users per package** (`cr.so.o2c`, `cr.so.md`, `cr.so.vendor`).

### 📊 Scaling Example

- **Single Package (Sales O2C):** 3 users (`cr.so.o2c`, `cr.so.md`, `cr.so.vendor`)
- **Complete Implementation (4 packages):** 12 users (4 × 3 tiers)
- **Traditional Approach:** ~39 users (per Package)
- **PDCP Reduction:** 39 → 12 = **69% credential reduction** (27 fewer users)

In a complete PDCP implementation with **4 domain packages** (Sales, Finance, Logistics, Procurement), this tiered strategy scales to **12 total users** (4 packages × 3 tiers each), resulting in a **69% reduction** from the traditional ~39 users (1 per package).

### "One Business Domain = One CPI Package = Tiered Technical Users"

Governance does not mean creating a single point of failure. By grouping your iFlows into **"Security Clusters"** within the same package, you ensure that a lockout in a non-critical sync (like a price update) doesn't kill your entire Sales operation.

### 3.2 The Technical User Strategy: Avoiding the "Total Blackout"

While PDCP consolidates iFlows, using a **single Technical User** for an entire domain is a high-risk move. To mitigate this, we apply **Sub-domain Tiering**.

#### The Solution: Segregation by Criticality

Instead of one set of credentials for everything, you split technical users based on their **business impact**:

1. **Transactional Core User** (`cr.so.o2c`)  
   Dedicated to high-volume, mission-critical flows like Order Creation. If this locks, it's a P1—but it is isolated from other failures.

2. **Support/Master Data User** (`cr.so.md`)  
   Dedicated to secondary flows like Customer Sync or Price Updates.

3. **Third-Party Specific User** (Optional)  
   If a specific vendor (e.g., a 3PL) is prone to sending bad requests that could trigger account lockouts, they receive their own isolated credential.

#### Why this is superior

- **Blast Radius Control:** If the "Master Data" user is locked due to an expired password, your "Order Creation" flow continues to run without interruption.
- **Audit Precision:** When a "401 Unauthorized" appears in the logs, you immediately know if the issue lies within the Core Transaction or a Support Flow.
- **Naming Symmetry:** The credential name follows the PDCP DNA: `cr.[domain].[subdomain]` (e.g., `cr.so.o2c`).

### Example: 4 Domain Packages with Tiered Users

| Domain Package | Tiered Users (3 per package) | Total Users |
|---|---|---|
| `nx.sales.o2c.integrations` | `cr.so.o2c`, `cr.so.md`, `cr.so.vendor` | 3 |
| `nx.finance.r2r.integrations` | `cr.fi.core`, `cr.fi.reporting`, `cr.fi.vendor` | 3 |
| `nx.logistics.tm.integrations` | `cr.log.shipment`, `cr.log.tracking`, `cr.log.vendor` | 3 |
| `nx.procurement.p2p.integrations` | `cr.proc.po`, `cr.proc.invoice`, `cr.proc.vendor` | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | | **12** |

### Traditional Approach (BEFORE)

- **39 packages**
- **~390 iFlows** (39 packages × 10 avg)
- **~39 technical users** (1 per package)
- **Problem:** Credential management nightmare; single-user lockout = all iFlows down

### PDCP Solution (AFTER)

- **4 packages**
- **13 iFlows** (Sales O2C example)
- **12 tiered users** (3 per package × 4 packages)
- **Benefits:** Blast radius control; precise audit trail; credential management simplified (↓97%)

**Architect's Note:** These naming standards are expert recommendations. Every organization must analyze its landscape and adapt these rules to their specific governance needs. This framework is a direct response to documented architectural failures where "one user for all" led to total system paralysis.

## 4. PDCP NAMING CONVENTION FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Package Naming Standard

In the previous DCRP blog, I suggested name convention to the SAP CPI Package:  
`[company-prefix].[business-domain].domain.process`

After reflection, this simpler format is more suitable:

**Format:** `[company-prefix].[business-domain].[sap-subprocess-domain].integrations`

This structure ensures every package is a self-contained **"Intelligence Domain"**. Using `[sub-process].integrations` represents all integrations for a business domain subprocess within a single package, eliminating Package Sprawl caused by sender-application-based or division-based naming. As shown in Figure 9, the consolidation reduces 30 packages to 4 strategic domains.

#### ✅ Correct

```
nx.sales.o2c.integrations    (Order-to-Cash)
nx.sales.crm.integrations    (CRM integrations)
nx.sales.pri.integrations    (Pricing)
nx.sales.reb.integrations    (Rebates)
nx.sales.sd.integrations     (Sales & Distribution)
```

#### ❌ WRONG

```
SalesForce_Integration_V2 
Orders_Package_Final 
NewSalesIntegration 
D365-Orders-Inbound
```

![Figure 9: Package Consolidation](images/figura-09-package-consolidation.png)  
*Figure 9: Reducing 30 Packages to 4 Strategic Domains*

### 4.2 - Package Consolidation: Immediate ROI

| Metric | Before | After | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPI Packages | 39 | 4 | ↓ 90% |
| iFlows | ~390 (39 × 10 avg) | 13 (consolidated) | ↓ 97% |
| Technical Users | ~39 (1 per package) | 12 (tiered) | ↓69% |
| Deploy Time | 273 min (~4.5h) | 14.5 min (~0.24h) | ↑ 18.8× faster |
| ALM Search | 10 min | 5 sec | ↑ 120× faster |
| Credential Management | 390 credentials | 12 credentials | ↓ 97% |
| Governance Overhead | 39 packages + 390 users | 4 packages + 12 users | ↓ 97% |

#### Deploy Time Calculation

**Before:**  
`T_total = (39 packages × 2 min) + (390 iFlows × 0.5 min) = 78 min + 195 min = 273 min (~4.5h per deployment)`

**After:**  
`T_total = (4 packages × 2 min) + (13 iFlows × 0.5 min) = 8 min + 6.5 min = 14.5 min per deployment`

> **Note:** Theoretical calculation (273 min) vs observed performance (228 min) reflects optimization in real implementation.

> **Note:** ROI based on real implementation - 13 iFlows (id01→id13) distributed across 6 subprocesses (Orders, Payments, Customers, Invoices, Deliveries, Returns) deployed in 45 minutes. Metrics are estimates based on real-world observations from SAP CPI tenant across three tiers (dev, qas, prd). Actual results may vary depending on team size, integration complexity, and organizational maturity. The core principle remains: **fewer, well-organized packages significantly reduce operational overhead.**

### 4.3 - SCALABILITY PROJECTION

> **Note:** This is a simulation and projection based on current metrics, not actual production data. However, it demonstrates the practical difference in scalability between traditional linear growth and PDCP's metadata-driven approach.

#### Growth with 100 additional integrations

| Metric | Linear Growth (Before) | PDCP Growth (After) | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Packages | 39 → 139 (+100) | 4 → 4 (zero growth) | +100 packages avoided |
| iFlows | 390 → 490 (+100) | 13 → 113 (+100) | Consolidated in 4 packages |
| Technical Users | 39 → 139 (+100) | 12 → 24 (tiered strategy) | +115 users |
| └─ Transactional Core | N/A (1 per iFlow) | 4 users → 8 users | Mission-critical isolation |
| └─ Support/Master Data | N/A (1 per iFlow) | 4 users → 8 users | Risk segregation |
| └─ Third-Party Specific | N/A (1 per iFlow) | 4 users → 8 users | Vendor isolation |
| Deploy Time | 237h/year → 453h/year | 12.5h/year → 56h/year | 397h saved/year |
| Maintenance Effort | 39 objects → 139 objects | 4 objects → 4 objects | +100 objects avoided |

#### Deploy Time Analysis - Per-Deployment Calculation

**Current State (Before Growth):**

- **Traditional:** `T = (39 pkg × 2 min) + (390 iFlows × 0.5 min) = 78 + 195 = 273 min (~4.5h)`
- **PDCP:** `T = (4 pkg × 2 min) + (13 iFlows × 0.5 min) = 8 + 6.5 = 14.5 min (~0.24h)`

**After 100 New Integrations:**

- **Traditional:** `T = (139 pkg × 2 min) + (490 iFlows × 0.5 min) = 278 + 245 = 523 min (~8.7h)`  
  Growth: 273 min → 523 min (+250 min, +92% increase)

- **PDCP:** `T = (4 pkg × 2 min) + (113 iFlows × 0.5 min) = 8 + 56.5 = 64.5 min (~1.1h)`  
  Growth: 14.5 min → 64.5 min (+50 min, +345% increase)

**Key Insight:** While PDCP deploy time increases by 345% (14.5→64.5 min), it still deploys **8× faster** than Traditional (64.5 min vs 523 min). Traditional approach becomes exponentially worse with scale.

#### Annual Impact (52 deployments/year)

| Scenario | Traditional | PDCP | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current State | 273 min × 52 = 237h/year | 14.5 min × 52 = 12.5h/year | 224.5h/year (↓95%) |
| After +100 integrations | 523 min × 52 = 453h/year | 64.5 min × 52 = 56h/year | 397h/year (↓88%) |
| 5-Year Projection | 2,265 hours | 280 hours | 1,985 hours saved |

**Business Value:** At 100 EUR/hour engineering cost, PDCP saves **€198,500 over 5 years** in deployment labor alone (excluding reduced incident response, faster onboarding, and governance overhead).

#### Why PDCP Scales Better

**Traditional Linear Growth:**
- Each new integration = +1 package
- Each package = +2 min deploy time
- Growth is additive per integration

**PDCP Metadata-Driven Growth:**
- New integrations → Same 4 packages
- Only iFlow count increases
- Growth is consolidated within domains
- Package overhead stays constant (4 packages = 8 min baseline)

**Result:** PDCP maintains sub-linear scalability — as integrations grow, the percentage of time spent on package deployment decreases.

#### Key Benefits

- ✅ Clear ownership—each domain has defined boundaries
- ✅ Knowledge retention—structure survives team turnover
- ✅ Faster releases—reduced dependency complexity

*Figure 10 - From Chaos to Clarity: PDCP Package Naming Framework*

### 4.4 - The "Single Container" Logic

One package per domain subprocess eliminates clutter. But to prevent this "Single Container" from becoming a junk drawer, three rules are mandatory:

1. **Surgical Indexing:** Use strict iFlow naming standards (detailed in Section 5) to keep the package sorted and searchable.
2. **System Abstraction:** Stop naming by system (Salesforce/SAP). Name by business process to ensure the package remains a reusable service hub.
3. **Discovery First:** Within this single container, naming is your only navigation tool—especially critical for SAP Cloud ALM integration.

> **Note:** The internal organization of name convention that makes this centralization possible is detailed in the sections below.

### 4.5 The "Main" Philosophy

Why avoid sub-process names like `.orders` or `.invoices` in the package title?

- **Scalability:** One package per domain prevents "Package Sprawl" from ever returning. It caps your tenant complexity.
- **Abstraction:** As an Expert, you design for the Domain Authority. Whether you have 10 or 50 sub-processes, they are all children of the same business unit.
- **Operational Discipline:** It forces developers to resolve complexity through iFlow DNA within the domain, rather than littering the tenant with orphaned, small-scope packages.

---

## 5 - The Advanced iFlow DNA name

In the previous blog I didn't provide any format of design name and convention name for Iflow. What I wrote there was just sample perspective - `SO.01.Iflow.Sales.Order.Inbound` - `SO.02.Iflow.Sales.Order.Tracking`. This was just representative, now I would suggest the structure below.

Instead of amateur or purely sequential names, we establish a **standardized name convention** for every integration asset. This transforms a cluttered tenant into a surgical, searchable, and reusable service library.

**Format:**  
`id[seq].[subdomain].[sender].[entity].[action].[direction].[sync/async]`

### Architect's Note: Complexity with Purpose

You might be questioned: **"Isn't this name too long?"**

My answer is simple: **Complexity must live somewhere.** This naming structure is a high-level architectural suggestion requiring strong governance. When adopting the "One Package per Business Domain" model, **the name is your only metadata**. Without including the Sub-domain, Sender, and Receiver, you will inevitably hit **Index Duplication** or "Name Collisions." This detail is the only way to ensure surgical isolation and prevent your domain package from becoming a "black box" of identical-looking flows.

> **Important:** This pattern focuses on **internal CPI organization**. While it is optimized for synergy with the DCRP Gateway, its primary goal is to ensure that your domain package does not become a "black box" of identical-looking flows.

### The design and name convention breakdown

| Component | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Seq** | Sequence Number (Indexing) | 01, 02, 03 |
| **Subdomain** | Specific Business Process | o2c, r2r, le, p2p |
| **Sender** | Source System | salesforce, magento, 3pl |
| **Entity** | Business Object (Qualifier) | order, customer, invoice |
| **Action** | Function Performed | c(create), r (read), u (update), d (delete), s (sync), a (approve) |
| **Receiver** | Target System | s4hana, sap, quickbooks, fedex |
| **Direction** | Data Flow | in, out |
| **Processing** | sync or async | sync or async |

### Action Codes Table

To ensure everyone is aligned, you can present the Action Codes like this:

| Code | Action | Business Intent | Example use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **c** | Create | Creating new records | Creating a new sales order |
| **r** | Read | Retrieving or fetching data | Retrieving customer master data |
| **u** | Update | Modifying existing records | Updating order status |
| **d** | Delete | Removing records | Deleting cancelled orders |
| **s** | Sync | Continuous synchronization | Syncing product catalog |
| **p** | Post | Submitting data for processing | Posting journal entries to ERP |
| **a** | Approve | Workflow or status transitions | Approving purchase requisition |
| **n** | Notify | Sending notifications or alerts | Sending shipment tracking notification |
| **q** | Query | Complex search or reporting | Querying inventory availability |
| **v** | Validate | Pre-processing validation | Validating order data before creation |
| **t** | Transform | Data format transformation | Converting EDI to XML format |
| **e** | Enrich | Adding supplementary data | Enriching order with pricing information |
| **m** | Merge | Combining data from multiple sources | Merging customer data from CRM and ERP |
| **x** | Execute | Triggering business logic or workflow | Executing credit check workflow |
| **b** | Batch | Processing multiple records in bulk | Nightly batch invoice generation |

### 5.1 - Sequential Indexing Logic

The sequence number (`id[seq]`) provides a simple, incremental index within each package.

#### Domain: Sales Samples | Subprocess: o2c (Order-to-Cash)

```
id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.c.in.sync       (Create order from Salesforce to S/4HANA)
id02.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.u.in.sync       (Update order from Salesforce to S/4HANA)
id03.o2c.shopify.customer.s4hana.s.in.sync       (Sync customer from Shopify to S/4HANA)
id04.o2c.stripe.payment.s4hana.n.in.sync         (Notify payment from Stripe to S/4HANA)
id05.o2c.s4hana.invoice.quickbooks.c.out.sync    (Create invoice from S/4HANA to QuickBooks)
```

#### Why reset per subdomain?

- ✅ Each subdomain becomes a self-contained index space
- ✅ Prevents collision across different business processes
- ✅ Easier to count flows within a specific subdomain (e.g., "How many O2C flows?")
- ✅ Natural grouping when sorted alphabetically
- ✅ Simple, predictable numbering (id01, id02, id03...)
- ✅ Easy to count total flows in a package
- ✅ Natural alphabetical sorting by ID
- ✅ Clear audit trail (id05 created after id04)

**Key Rule:**  
The sequence starts at `id01` for each new subdomain within the same package.

**Package:** `nx.sales.o2c.integrations`  
**Coverage:** Orders, Payments, Customers, Invoices, Deliveries, Returns

> ⚠️ **Important Note on Endpoint Patterns:**  
> The "Endpoint Pattern SAP CPI" column below and further shows URLs using the `/http/dcrp/` and `/cxf/dcrp/` prefixes.  
> These patterns are specific to **DCRP + PDCP synergy** (covered in Chapter 7) and are used to enable metadata-driven routing via the DCRP JavaScript engine.
>
> If you are implementing **PDCP standalone** (without API Gateway), these patterns are **NOT mandatory**. You are free to define your own URL conventions. As suggestion, please check sector **(6. The URL Governance: The Agnostic Endpoint - Only SAP CPI)**. The only PDCP requirement is that your URL must reflect the iFlow DNA for traceability (entity, action, and ID).
>
> Examples of valid standalone PDCP endpoints:
> - `/orders/create/id01`
> - `/api/sales/orders/id01`
> - `/integrations/o2c/orders/id01`
>
> 🚨 This blog does **NOT** provide an official pattern for HTTP vs SOAP adapter selection or standard URL path structures—these decisions are left to your organizational needs but some suggestions on the sector 6.

| ID | Sender | Entity | Receiver | Action | Direction | Processing | Protocol | Endpoint Pattern SAP CPI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| id01 | salesforce | orders | s4hana | c | in | sync | REST | `/http/dcrp/orders/c/id01` |
| id02 | salesforce | orders | s4hana | u | in | sync | REST | `/http/dcrp/orders/u/id02` |
| id03 | shopify | customers | s4hana | s | in | sync | REST | `/http/dcrp/customers/s/id03` |
| id04 | stripe | payments | s4hana | n | in | sync | REST | `/http/dcrp/payments/n/id04` |
| id05 | microsoft | orders | s4hana | c | in | sync | SOAP | `/cxf/dcrp/orders/c/id05` |
| id06 | fedex | deliveries | s4hana | t | in | sync | REST | `/http/dcrp/deliveries/t/id06` |
| id07 | s4hana | customers | externalcrm | s | out | sync | SOAP | `/cxf/dcrp/customers/s/id07` |
| id08 | s4hana | payments | externalpay | n | out | sync | SOAP | `/cxf/dcrp/payments/n/id08` |
| id09 | quickbooks | invoices | s4hana | c | in | sync | SOAP | `/cxf/dcrp/invoices/c/id09` |
| id10 | s4hana | invoices | externalbill | c | out | sync | REST | `/http/dcrp/invoices/c/id10` |
| id11 | s4hana | deliveries | externallog | t | out | sync | SOAP | `/cxf/dcrp/deliveries/t/id11` |
| id12 | shopify | returns | s4hana | c | in | sync | REST | `/http/dcrp/returns/c/id12` |
| id13 | s4hana | returns | externalret | c | out | sync | SOAP | `/cxf/dcrp/returns/c/id13` |

### 5.2 - What if I have multiple instances of the same system?

Differentiate in the `[sender]` field:

**Common patterns:**

- **Region:** `sfusa`, `sfemea`, `sfapac`
- **Environment:** `s4prod`, `s4qa`, `s4dev`
- **Division:** `sapretail`, `sapwholesale`

| Scenario | Solution | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 2 Salesforce (US/EMEA) | Append region code | `id01.o2c.salesforceus.order.s4hana.c.in.sync` vs `id05.o2c.salesforceemea.order.s4hana.c.in.sync` |
| 2 S/4HANA (Prod/QA) | Append environment | `id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4prod.c.in.sync` vs `id02.o2c.salesforce.order.s4qa.c.in.sync` |
| Same system, different entities | Use `[entity]` | `id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.c.in.sync` vs `id03.o2c.salesforce.customer.s4hana.s.in.sync` |

![Figure 11: IFlow Design and Naming Convention](images/figura-11-iflow-design.png)  
*Figure 11 - IFlow design and naming convention*

### 5.3 - Implementation Strategy

#### Why Not One Global iFlow per package?

Relying on a single iFlow with complex internal routing is unsustainable and risky.

**The Problem:**
- One bug breaks everything
- Testing impacts production
- Impossible to isolate failures

**The PDCP Solution:**

- ✅ **Risk Isolation** - A bug in Magento mapping never breaks Salesforce flows
- ✅ **Surgical Deployment** - Deploy and test individual flows independently
- ✅ **Instant Discovery** - Alphabetical sorting by `[subdomain].[sender]` groups all flows naturally
- ✅ **Operational Clarity** - Failures are visible immediately: "Salesforce failed to create Order in S/4HANA"

**Example:**

- ❌ **Before:** One monolithic iFlow handles all order integrations
- ✅ **After:**  
  - `id01.o2c.salesforce.order.c.in.async`  
  - `id02.o2c.magento.order.c.in`  
  - `id03.o2c.shopify.order.c.in.async`

Your support team no longer digs through payloads. The failure is visible directly in SAP Cloud ALM or CPI Monitor.

### 5.4 - The Result: A Governed Domain Library

We have transformed the CPI tenant from a **"trash bin of integrations"** into a **Governed Domain Library**. You maintain a slim footprint with one package per domain, but inside, you have a fleet of specialized, high-performance iFlows that are easy to manage and impossible to lose.

![Figure 12: From Chaos to Governed Library](images/figura-12-governed-library.png)  
*Figure 12 - From Chaos to Governed Library*

## 6. The URL Governance: The Agnostic Endpoint - Only SAP CPI

PDCP governance extends beyond iFlow naming to the HTTP endpoint URL. A surgical iFlow name with a generic URL loses traceability.

**The Rule:** Your URL must be the **Agnostic Reflection of your iFlow DNA**.

### Why Include ID in the URL?

The `id` component serves as a unique identifier for the iFlow and its HTTP channel, enabling precise traceability in logs, monitoring tools, and troubleshooting.

### URL Format Strategy

The URL format depends on your architectural approach:

#### Option 1: Full Context (Recommended)

**Format:** `/[entity]/[action]/[id]`

**Examples (Sales O2C):**

```
/orders/c/id01      → id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.c.in.sync
/orders/u/id02      → id02.o2c.salesforceemea.order.s4hana.u.in.sync
/customers/s/id03   → id03.o2c.shopify.customer.s4hana.s.in.sync
/payments/n/id04    → id04.o2c.stripe.payment.s4hana.n.in.sync
/orders/c/id05      → id05.o2c.microsoft.order.s4hana.c.in.sync
/deliveries/t/id06  → id06.o2c.fedex.delivery.s4hana.t.in.sync
/customers/s/id07   → id07.o2c.s4hana.customer.externalcrm.s.out.async
/payments/n/id08    → id08.o2c.s4hana.payment.externalpay.n.out.async
/invoices/c/id09    → id09.o2c.quickbooks.invoice.s4hana.c.in.sync
/invoices/c/id10    → id10.o2c.s4hana.invoice.externalbill.c.out.async
/deliveries/t/id11  → id11.o2c.s4hana.delivery.externallog.t.out.async
/returns/c/id12     → id12.o2c.shopify.return.s4hana.c.in.sync
/returns/c/id13     → id13.o2c.s4hana.return.externalret.c.out.async
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Full context in URL (entity + action + id)
- ✅ Direct mapping to iFlow name
- ✅ Easy troubleshooting (URL = iFlow identifier)

#### Option 2: Simplified

**Format:** `/[entity]/[id]`

**Examples (Sales O2C):**

```
/orders/id01      → id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.c.in.sync
/orders/id02      → id02.o2c.salesforceemea.order.s4hana.u.in.sync
/customers/id03   → id03.o2c.shopify.customer.s4hana.s.in.sync
/payments/id04    → id04.o2c.stripe.payment.s4hana.n.in.sync
/orders/id05      → id05.o2c.microsoft.order.s4hana.c.in.sync
/deliveries/id06  → id06.o2c.fedex.delivery.s4hana.t.in.sync
/customers/id07   → id07.o2c.s4hana.customer.externalcrm.s.out.async
/payments/id08    → id08.o2c.s4hana.payment.externalpay.n.out.async
/invoices/id09    → id09.o2c.quickbooks.invoice.s4hana.c.in.sync
/invoices/id10    → id10.o2c.s4hana.invoice.externalbill.c.out.async
/deliveries/id11  → id11.o2c.s4hana.delivery.externallog.t.out.async
/returns/id12     → id12.o2c.shopify.return.s4hana.c.in.sync
/returns/id13     → id13.o2c.s4hana.return.externalret.c.out.async
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Cleaner URLs
- ✅ Entity-based grouping
- ✅ ID provides uniqueness

#### Option 3: Domain Prefix

**Format:** `/sales/[entity]/[action]/[id]`

**Examples (Sales O2C):**

```
/sales/orders/c/id01      → id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.c.in.sync
/sales/orders/u/id02      → id02.o2c.salesforceemea.order.s4hana.u.in.sync
/sales/customers/s/id03   → id03.o2c.shopify.customer.s4hana.s.in.sync
/sales/payments/n/id04    → id04.o2c.stripe.payment.s4hana.n.in.sync
/sales/orders/c/id05      → id05.o2c.microsoft.order.s4hana.c.in.sync
/sales/deliveries/t/id06  → id06.o2c.fedex.delivery.s4hana.t.in.sync
/sales/customers/s/id07   → id07.o2c.s4hana.customer.externalcrm.s.out.async
/sales/payments/n/id08    → id08.o2c.s4hana.payment.externalpay.n.out.async
/sales/invoices/c/id09    → id09.o2c.quickbooks.invoice.s4hana.c.in.sync
/sales/invoices/c/id10    → id10.o2c.s4hana.invoice.externalbill.c.out.async
/sales/deliveries/t/id11  → id11.o2c.s4hana.delivery.externallog.t.out.async
/sales/returns/c/id12     → id12.o2c.shopify.return.s4hana.c.in.sync
/sales/returns/c/id13     → id13.o2c.s4hana.return.externalret.c.out.async
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Domain-level organization
- ✅ Clear business context
- ✅ Scalable across multiple domains

### Important Note

The `id` prefix is purely an identifier, not a version indicator. Versioning should be managed separately through API versioning strategies (e.g., `/v1/`, `/v2/`).

## 7 - DCRP + PDCP implementation and KVM configuration

**SCOPE:** This section covers **DCRP + PDCP integration** (Gateway + CPI). For standalone CPI APIs without Gateway, refer to **Section 6** (URL Governance).

### 7.1 The Challenge: Traditional 1:1 Architecture

Traditional 1:1 architecture would require **13 separate API Proxies** to cover the complete Sales O2C landscape:

#### ❌ TRADITIONAL APPROACH (13 PROXIES)

| # | API-Proxy | Entity | Deploy Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | OrderCreationProxy | Orders | 15 min |
| 2 | OrderUpdateProxy | Orders (Update) | 15 min |
| 3 | CustomerSyncProxy | Customers | 15 min |
| 4 | PaymentNotificationProxy | Payments | 15 min |
| 5 | OrderCreationSOAPProxy | Orders (SOAP) | 15 min |
| 6 | DeliveryTrackingProxy | Deliveries | 15 min |
| 7 | CustomerSyncSOAPProxy | Customers (SOAP) | 15 min |
| 8 | PaymentNotificationSOAPProxy | Payments (SOAP) | 15 min |
| 9 | InvoiceCreationProxy | Invoices | 15 min |
| 10 | InvoiceOutboundProxy | Invoices (Outbound) | 15 min |
| 11 | DeliveryTrackingSOAPProxy | Deliveries (SOAP) | 15 min |
| 12 | ReturnCreationProxy | Returns | 15 min |
| 13 | ReturnCreationSOAPProxy | Returns (SOAP) | 15 min |

**Total Deployment Overhead:**

- **Initial Deployment:** 13 proxies × 15 min = **3.25 hours**
- **Security Policies:** 13 separate policies
- **Monitoring Dashboards:** 13 separate dashboards
- **Credential Management:** 13 credential sets
- **Maintenance:** 13 objects to manage

When **DCRP (Gateway)** and **PDCP (CPI)** work together, you achieve end-to-end domain governance:

**Gateway Layer (DCRP):** Facade URLs, metadata-driven routing, vendor disambiguation  
**Orchestration Layer (PDCP):** Surgical iFlow naming, package consolidation, tiered users

**The Synergy:**

```
Client → [Gateway DCRP] → [KVM Lookup] → [JavaScript v8.0] → [CPI PDCP Package] → Backend
```

#### ✅ DCRP SOLUTION (1 UNIFIED PROXY)

**Proxy Name:** `cpi-dcrp-proxy-domain-sales-o2c`

**Route Rules (all point to same Target Endpoint):**

| DCRP - One API-PROXY | Route Name | Route Rules | Target CPI Iflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cpi-dcrp-proxy-domain-sales-o2c` | sales-o2c-orders | `/orders/**` | `id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.c.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-orders | `/orders/**` | `id02.o2c.salesforceemea.order.s4hana.u.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-customers | `/customers/**` | `id03.o2c.shopify.customer.s4hana.s.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-payments | `/payments/**` | `id04.o2c.stripe.payment.s4hana.n.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-orders | `/orders/**` | `id05.o2c.microsoft.order.s4hana.c.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-deliveries | `/deliveries/**` | `id06.o2c.fedex.delivery.s4hana.t.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-customers | `/customers/**` | `id07.o2c.s4hana.customer.externalcrm.s.out.async` |
| " | sales-o2c-payments | `/payments/**` | `id08.o2c.s4hana.payment.externalpay.n.out.async` |
| " | sales-o2c-invoices | `/invoices/**` | `id09.o2c.quickbooks.invoice.s4hana.c.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-invoices | `/invoices/**` | `id10.o2c.s4hana.invoice.externalbill.c.out.async` |
| " | sales-o2c-deliveries | `/deliveries/**` | `id11.o2c.s4hana.delivery.externallog.t.out.async` |
| " | sales-o2c-returns | `/returns/**` | `id12.o2c.shopify.return.s4hana.c.in.sync` |
| " | sales-o2c-returns | `/returns/**` | `id13.o2c.s4hana.return.externalret.c.out.async` |

![Figure 13: DCRP API-Proxy Configuration](images/figura-13-dcrp-proxy-config.png)  
*Figure 13 - DCRP API-Proxy - Sales - O2C Configuration - cpi-dcrp-proxy-domain-sales-o2c*

**Deployment Overhead:**

- **Initial Deployment:** 1 proxy × 2 min = **2 minutes**
- **Security Policies:** 1 centralized policy
- **Monitoring Dashboards:** 1 unified dashboard
- **Credential Management:** 1 credential set
- **Maintenance:** 1 object to manage

#### IMPACT: TRADITIONAL vs DCRP

| Metric | Traditional 1:1 Implementation | DCRP - API-Proxy | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial Deployment | 3.25 hours | 2 minutes | ↓99% |
| New Integration Setup | 15 min | 30 sec | ↓97% |
| Security Policies | 13 | 1 | ↓92% |
| Monitoring Dashboards | 13 | 1 | ↓92% |
| Credential Management | 13 | 1 | ↓92% |
| Maintenance | 13 objects | 1 object | ↓92% |

**Key Takeaway:** DCRP eliminates proxy sprawl by consolidating routing logic into metadata-driven rules inside a single intelligent gateway that scales via configuration.

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Single facade endpoint handles multiple vendors
- ✅ Zero-code vendor onboarding (metadata-only)
- ✅ End-to-end traceability (Facade → iFlow)
- ✅ Consistent governance across Gateway and CPI

### 7.2 The Routing Flow (Step-by-Step)

#### Step 1: External API (Client-facing)

Client calls the agnostic facade with vendor identifier:

```
POST /sales/orders/creation/<vendor>
PUT  /sales/orders/update/<vendor>
```

Client calls the agnostic facade with vendor identifier:

```
POST /sales/orders/creation/salesforce 
POST /sales/orders/creation/microsoft 
PUT  /sales/orders/update/salesforce
```

#### Why '<vendor>' is Required?

In real-world scenarios, multiple vendors integrate with the same business process:

- Salesforce sends order creation
- Microsoft Dynamics sends order creation
- MuleSoft sends order creation

Without `<vendor>`, all would route to the same iFlow.

**Causing:**

- ❌ Mapping conflicts
- ❌ Cannot isolate vendor errors
- ❌ Cannot track vendor metrics
- ❌ Cannot apply vendor-specific security

**Alternative: Use explicit ID routing**

```
POST /sales/orders/creation/id01 (Salesforce) 
POST /sales/orders/creation/id05 (Microsoft)
```

> ⚠️ **Important: DCRP + PDCP is Not Magic**  
> The routing engine requires explicit identification (`<vendor>` or `<id>`) to determine the target iFlow.
>
> **Context:** These are architectural guidelines, not universal solutions. Evaluate, adapt, and extend them to fit your specific context.

#### Step 2: Gateway Internal Conversion (JavaScript + KVM)

The Gateway converts facade URLs to PDCP-compliant routing keys:

```
/sales/orders/creation/salesforce → dcrporderscid01
/sales/orders/creation/microsoft  → dcrporderscid05
/sales/orders/update/salesforce   → dcrpordersuid02
```

#### Step 3: KVM Lookup

Gateway queries the Key-Value Map:

```
dcrporderscid01:http,dcrpordersuid02:http,dcrpcustomerssid03:http,
dcrppaymentsnid04:http,dcrporderscid05:cxf,dcrpdeliveriestid06:http,
dcrpcustomerssid07:cxf,dcrppaymentsnid08:cxf,dcrpinvoicescid09:cxf,
dcrpinvoicescid10:cxf,dcrpdeliveriestid11:cxf,dcrpreturnscid12:http,dcrpreturnscid13:cxf
```

![Figure 14: KVM Configuration](images/figura-14-kvm-config.png)  
*Figure 14 - Configuration of KVM CPI Package - nx.sales.o2c.integrations*

#### Step 4: JavaScript Routing Engine (v8.0)

The routing engine:

1. Decodes compact URL: `dcrporderscid01` → `/dcrp/orders/c/id01`
2. Identifies adapter: `http`
3. Constructs target URL: `https://tenant.../http/dcrp/orders/c/id01`

```
idinterface:dcrporderscid01:http,dcrpordersuid02:id02.o2c.salesforce.order.u.in,dcrporderscid05:id05.o2c.microsoft.order.c.in,dcrpcustomerssid03:id03.o2c.magento.customer.s.in,dcrppaymentsnid04:id04.o2c.shopify.payment.n.out
```

Don't worry! The JavaScript v8.0 engine handles this automatically. Unlike the Blog Part I (which used human-readable names like `inbound`, `tracking`, `status`), PDCP uses structured action codes (`c`, `u`, `s`) for consistency and automation.

![Figure 15: PDCP URL Decoding](images/figura-15-url-decoding.png)  
*Figure 15 - PDCP URL Decoding: All 15 Action Codes Validated*

#### Step 5: CPI Execution - Samples

CPI receives the request and executes the mapped iFlow:

| DCRP - One API-Proxy | Facade URL (APIM) `https://tenantapiportal...` | Target URL - SAP CPI `https://tenant...` | Iflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cpi-dcrp-proxy-domain-sales-o2c` | `/sales/orders/creation/salesforce` | `/http/dcrp/orders/c/id01` | id01 |
| " | `/sales/orders/update/salesforceemea` | `/http/dcrp/orders/u/id02` | id02 |
| " | `/sales/customers/sync/shopify` | `/http/dcrp/customers/s/id03` | id03 |
| " | `/sales/payments/notification/stripe` | `/http/dcrp/payments/n/id04` | id04 |
| " | `/sales/orders/creation/microsoft` | `/cxf/dcrp/orders/c/id05` | id05 |
| " | `/sales/deliveries/tracking/fedex` | `/http/dcrp/deliveries/t/id06` | id06 |
| " | `/sales/customers/sync/s4hana` | `/cxf/dcrp/customers/s/id07` | id07 |
| " | `/sales/payments/notification/s4hana` | `/cxf/dcrp/payments/n/id08` | id08 |
| " | `/sales/invoices/creation/quickbooks` | `/cxf/dcrp/invoices/c/id09` | id09 |
| " | `/sales/invoices/creation/s4hana` | `/http/dcrp/invoices/c/id10` | id10 |
| " | `/sales/deliveries/tracking/s4hana` | `/cxf/dcrp/deliveries/t/id11` | id11 |
| " | `/sales/returns/creation/shopify` | `/http/dcrp/returns/c/id12` | id12 |
| " | `/sales/returns/creation/s4hana` | `/cxf/dcrp/returns/c/id13` | id13 |

### 7.3 KVM Structure & Configuration

#### KVM Anatomy

Each domain has its own KVM with three key fields:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **packagename** | CPI Package identifier | `nx.sales.o2c.integrations` |
| **saprocess** | Business process description | SAP SD & O2C - Sales Process |
| **idinterface** | Routing metadata (compact URL : iFlow : adapter) | `dcrporderscid01:http` / `dcrporderscid05:cxf` |

#### BREAKDOWN orientation of iflowname field

| Component | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Routing Key | `dcrporderscid01:cxf` | Compact URL usado pelo Gateway |
| iFlow Name | `id01.o2c.salesforceus.orders.s4hana.c.in.sync` | iFlow real no CPI |
| Adapter Type | `soap` | Define o prefixo do endpoint CPI |

#### WHY :http AT THE END?

**PURPOSE**  
The third parameter (`:http` or `:cfx`) tells the JavaScript routing engine which adapter the CPI iFlow uses.

**HOW IT WORKS**

**HTTP Adapter:**
- KVM: `dcrporderscid01:http`
- Target URL: `https://tenant.../http/dcrp/orders/c/id01`

**SOAP Adapter:**
- KVM: `dcrpinvoicescid03:cfx`
- Target URL: `https://tenant.../cfx/dcrp/invoices/c/id03`

#### WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CODE - JAVASCRIPT the BRAIN Machine

```javascript
// Section 3: Parse KVM entry
var parts = entry.split(':');
var dcrpPath = parts[0];           // "dcrporderscid01"
var adapter = parts[1] || "http";  // "http" (default if omitted)

// Section 6: Build target URL
var targetUrl = cpiHost + "/" + adapter + "/" + decodedPath;
// Result: https://tenant.../http/dcrp/orders/c/id01
```

#### WHEN CAN YOU OMIT :http?

If **ALL iFlows** that is going to use DCRP + PDCP in the package use HTTP:

**KVM (omitting :http):**
```
dcrporderscid01:dcrpordersuid02
```

The code uses default: `var adapter = parts[2] || "http";`

#### WHEN MUST YOU SPECIFY IT?

If there's a **MIX of HTTP and SOAP** in the same package:

**KVM (mixed adapters):**
```
dcrporderscid01:http,dcrpinvoicescid03:cfx,dcrpexpensescid01:http
```

#### SUMMARY

- ✅ `:http` = HTTP adapter → `/http/dcrp/...`
- ✅ `:cfx` = SOAP adapter → `/cfx/dcrp/...`
- ✅ Omitted = defaults to HTTP

### 7.4 - KVM Symmetry: Map Identifier ↔ PDCP Package

To ensure the DCRP engine functions correctly, the **KVM Map Identifier** must mirror your **PDCP Package naming convention**. Figure 15 shows the KVM registration configuration:

| Business Domain | PDCP Package name | KVM Map Identifier |
|---|---|---|
| Sales | `nx.sales.o2c.integrations` | `cpipackage-nx.sales.o2c.integrations` |
| Finance | `nx.finance.r2r.integrations` | `cpipackage-nx.finance.r2r.integrations` |
| Logistics | `nx.logistics.tm.integrations` | `cpipackage-nx.logistics.tm.integrations` |
| Procurement | `nx.procurement.p2p.integrations` | `cpipackage-nx.procurement.p2p.integrations` |

![Figure 16: KVM Registration](images/figura-16-kvm-registration.png)  
*Figure 16 - KVM Registration in API Management*

### 7.5 - APIM Policy Configuration

In your API Management Policy in each DCRP API-Proxy, the sample below is how should be the XML Policy of **Key Value Mapping - Target Endpoint Pre-Flow**, reference the KVM:

### 7.6 Domain Implementation Examples

The facade URLs below show generic paths for simplicity. In production with multiple vendors, always include `<vendor>` or `<id>`:

- With vendor: `POST /sales/orders/creation/salesforce`
- With ID: `POST /sales/orders/creation/id01`

#### 1. SALES (nx.sales.o2c.integrations)

**Package Name:** `nx.sales.o2c.integrations`  
**SAP Process:** SAP SD & O2C - Sales Process  
**iFlows:** All 13 Sales O2C iFlows (id01–id13)

**Endpoints:**

| SAP API Management URL Facade | Protocol | SAP CPI endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/salesforce` | HTTP | `https://tenant.hci.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/http/dcrp/orders/c/id01` |
| `PUT /sales/orders/update/salesforceemea` | HTTP | `https://tenant.hci.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/http/dcrp/orders/u/id02` |

#### 2. FINANCE (nx.finance.r2r.integrations)

**Package Name:** `nx.finance.r2r.integrations`  
**SAP Process:** SAP FI & R2R - Record to Report  
**iFlows:** `id01.r2r.sap.invoice.externalbill.c.out.async` / `id03.r2r.ariba.expense.s4hana.a.in.sync`

**Endpoints:**

| SAP API Management URL Facade | Protocol | SAP CPI endpoint |

| `POST /finance/invoices/creation/sap` | SOAP | `https://tenant.hci.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/cxf/dcrp/invoices/c/id01` |

### 7.6 - Multi-Vendor Disambiguation: Real-World Examples

#### The Challenge

When multiple vendors (or multiple instances of the same vendor) integrate with the same process, you need sender-aware routing.

#### Example 1: Salesforce Multi-Region

| Facade URL - API Management | Vendor Instance | Routes to Iflow |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/salesforceus` | Salesforce US | `id01.o2c.salesforceus.order.c.in.sync` |
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/salesforceeu` | Salesforce EU | `id02.o2c.salesforceeu.order.c.in.sync` |
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/salesforceapac` | Salesforce APAC | `id03.o2c.salesforceapac.order.c.in.sync` |

**KVM Structure:**

```
kvm.idinterface:dcrporderscid01:http,dcrporderscid05:cxf,dcrporderscid09:http
```

#### Example 2: SAP S/4HANA Multi-Environment

Scenario: 2 S/4HANA systems (Production and QA) for invoice creation

| Facade URL - APIM Management | Environment | Routes to Iflow |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /finance/invoices/creation/s4prod` | Production | `id01.r2r.s4prod.invoice.c.out.sync` |
| `POST /finance/invoices/creation/s4qa` | QA/Test | `id10.r2r.s4qa.invoice.c.out.sync` |

**KVM Structure:**

```
kvm.idinterface:dcrpinvoicescid01:cfx,dcrpinvoicescid10:cfx
```

#### Example 3: Multiple E-Commerce Platforms

Scenario: 5 e-commerce platforms sending orders to the same process

| Facade URL | Platform | Routes to Iflow |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/shopify` | Shopify | `id04.o2c.shopify.order.c.in.sync` |
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/magento` | Magento | `id08.o2c.magento.order.c.in.sync` |
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/woocommerce` | WooCommerce | `id12.o2c.woocommerce.order.c.in.sync` |
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/vtex` | VTEX | `id16.o2c.vtex.order.c.in.sync` |
| `POST /sales/orders/creation/bigcommerce` | BigCommerce | `id20.o2c.bigcommerce.order.c.in.sync` |

**KVM Structure:**

```
kvm.idinterface:dcrporderscid04:http,dcrporderscid08:http,dcrporderscid12:cxf,
dcrporderscid16:cxf,dcrporderscid20:http
```

#### JavaScript v8.0 Routing Logic

1. Extract vendor from path: `/sales/orders/creation/salesforceus`
2. Match vendor in KVM: `salesforceus` → `dcrporderscid01:http`
3. Decode: `dcrporderscid01:http` → `/dcrp/orders/c/id01`
4. Route to: `https://tenant.../http/dcrp/orders/c/id01`
5. Execute iFlow: `id01.o2c.salesforceus.order.c.in.sync`

### 7.10 API Proxy Configuration

### COMING NEXT: PART III - THE IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

Part III will cover:

#### What You'll Get

- ✅ Production JavaScript v8.0 routing engine (full source code) ready for global implementation
- ✅ Conflict Resolution Guide (id09/id10 exact-match disambiguation)
- ✅ KVM Configuration Templates (copy-paste ready for 4 domains)
- ✅ Postman Collection (13 pre-configured integration tests)
- ✅ Monitoring & Troubleshooting Playbook (SAP Cloud ALM integration)
- ✅ GitHub repository with 📦:
  - Full source code
  - iFlow templates
  - KVM configs
  - Postman collections
  - Architecture diagrams

**Preview:** The JavaScript engine eliminates the id09/id10 conflict demonstrated in Section 7.11 by implementing vendor-aware exact-match routing with automatic adapter detection.

**Stay tuned!**

> **Note:** Notice that the URL is shorter than the iFlow name. This is because the DCPR Gateway handles the "who is who" via KVM, while the CPI simply provides a clean, standardized entry point.

## CONCLUSION: The Path to a Sustainable Landscape

The implementation of the **Package Domain-Centric Pattern (PDCP)** transforms an SAP Integration Suite tenant from a fragmented collection of point-to-point connections into a **Governed Domain Library**—a scalable, maintainable, and business-aligned integration ecosystem.

By adopting this framework, organizations achieve:

### Structural Order

Consolidation from **39+ fragmented packages into 4 domain-centric packages**, eliminating the complexity and overhead of managing hundreds of unstandardized integrations.  
**Result:** 90% reduction in governance objects, 97% reduction in technical users.

### Operational Isolation

Dedicated iFlows for specific system-to-system interactions with **tiered technical users by criticality**, ensuring that updates or bugs in one integration (e.g., a Salesforce order sync) do not create regression risks across the entire landscape.  
**Result:** Blast radius control and mission-critical isolation.

### Rapid Incident Resolution

A landscape where support teams can identify the root cause of a failure in seconds by interpreting the standardized naming taxonomy (`id01.o2c.salesforce.order.s4hana.c.in.sync`), without needing to inspect internal payloads or navigate through dozens of packages.  
**Result:** ALM search time reduced from 10 minutes to 5 seconds (120× faster).

### Deployment Velocity

From **273 minutes (~4.5h) per deployment cycle** (39 packages, 390 iFlows) to **14.5 minutes** (4 packages, 13 iFlows)—an **18.8× improvement**.

### From Technical Debt to Strategic Asset

This transition represents a fundamental shift in **Architectural Maturity**. By moving from "building integrations" to managing a **Business-Aligned Ecosystem**, you ensure that your integration layer remains a scalable asset rather than a growing liability.

**The technical foundation is now organized.**  
**The engine is tuned for enterprise scale.**  
**The governance is in your hands.**

> *"In the middle of package sprawl, order is your greatest tactical advantage. A clean backend is the silent engine that allows an enterprise to move at the speed of business, rather than the speed of technical debt."*  
> — **"The Commander"** - Viana

**The Battlefield is now organized. The Engine is tuned. The Command is yours.**
